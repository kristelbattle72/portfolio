 <h5>  Some similarities between python and scratch are we need to use code <br> some differrences is that on scratch they have charaters and on python theirs no code, Also on python you have to write more in code </h5>
  
  
<p> At first I felt confused becuase I didn't get it but once someone help me I understand what I had to do. <br> I liked that i finished <br> python for me was very hard <p>
 
     
  <p> today I learned the differnces between a robot and not a robot. Also we saw videos of inventions that can impact the world in a good and a bad way. Also, I learned how to light a circut. my group find differnt ways to light a light buld. <p>
 
  
  <p> for the future I'm excited of robotics would be to make the robots move talk. No i am not nervous.<p>
  
   
    <p> something that worked well was we all got along and we worked together. something that we should do more is ask questions when we needed help <p>
      
   
      <p> My group and I worked very good together, we planned out what we were going to do on the white board and, Then we did one thing at a time together so we would alL  understand it, and if I  didnt get something my team memberrs would explain it to me so I would unddrstand it more and we istened to high school musical and we took it easy but we did our work <p>
      
    <p> one thing i learned about the internet is that the ip address helps infomation get sent.

      <p> I would like to understand how to change the website name on termial. 
        <p> the dynamic feature i would like to learn the most would be to change the background on my website
          
          <p> I would want to add on my website is a differernt backgournd and also pictures. 
            
            <p> Something that makes a computer good at data would be when you are orginazed so you know what data you can put on your computer. 
              
             <p> I would use a dictionary for making a short list, I would use a list for writnitg a lot of information at one time. 
               
             <p> A similarity between a dictionary and a list would be you need both things to put data on a computer. 
               
              <p> I am most proud of working with my pathner on a poster and explaining it to the class
                
               <p> the most intersting was dijkstra because sisi explained so perfectly even though it looked confusing 
               
                <p> some limitations of my social program from yesterday was we wanted to make alexa sing a whole song but we could'nt because we only had a certain amount of time. 
                 
                  <p> the features that would be useful to add is, alexa can read messages that was on your phone
