 <h5>  Some similarities between python and scratch are we need to use code <br> some differrences is that on scratch they have charaters and on python theirs no code, Also on python you have to write more in code 
  
  
</body> At first I felt confused becuase I didn't get it but once someone help me I understand what I had to do. <br> I liked that i finished <br> python for me was very hard
 
     
  </body> today I learned the differnces between a robot and not a robot. Also we saw videos of inventions that can impact the world in a good and a bad way. Also, I learned how to light a circut. my group find differnt ways to light a light buld. 
 
  
  <h5> for the future I'm excited of robotics would be to make the robots move talk. No i am not nervous. 
  
   
    <h5> something that worked well was we all got along and we worked together. something that we should do more is ask questions when we needed help 
      
   
      <h5> My group and I worked very good together, we planned out what we were going to do on the white board and, Then we did one thing at a time together so we would alL  understand it, and if I  didnt get something my team memberrs would explain it to me so I would unddrstand it more and we istened to high school musical and we took it easy but we did our work
